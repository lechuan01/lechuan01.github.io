      <description>Requirements: Imagine you have to design a system for serving blogs to massive readers (10k tps). How would you design the system?
Solving: Step 1: Use cases and constraints: Use cases:  Who can write a blog ? (anyone or having specific constraints) Reader searches keywords, tags,&amp;hellip; Notice to readers for new blogs. &amp;hellip;  Constraints:  Massive readers - 10.000 transaction per second Search should be fast Read heavy or write heavy?</description>

      <description>Barcelona is my favourite football team. They play a simple and rhythmic football. My best Barca is the 2014-2015 Barca with M-S-N triad. They were a worry for all defenses at that time. With Iniesta-Sergio Busquest-Rakitic right below, Barcelona becomes an unstoppable team. He win Treble in 2014-2015 season. They won the treble in the 2014-2015 season, something not many teams can do. </description>
